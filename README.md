Vectorauth has designed, implemented and verified a novel cyber authentication method that uses Ultra-Wide-Band(UWB) wireless technology and Voice-ID and speech recognition AI models to make the cyber authentication secure, fast and automatic. VectorAuth accurately detects the user’s position to predict if the user needs to sign in. When confirmed, users use their voice to sign in without having to enter any passwords, and the access will automatically be revoked as soon as users move away from the device to avoid any security breaches. We built a prototype to demonstrate the complete authentication flow. The results showed that VectorAuth is a promising new authentication method. 

## The origin of our project idea

* One day in a hospital, we noticed that doctors still need to use their badges or enter a password to either enter a gate or access files on a PC, even during emergency.
* Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA), have several major shortcomings:
  * Passwords can easily be stolen
  * That verification SMS may take a long time to arrive
  * The security key usually grant 24 hour access which can cause security breach

## Our research goal
* Design, implement and verify a novel authentication solution that are:
  * Accurate -> Detects the user’s position in centimeter accuracy to predict if the user needs to sign in. 
  * Fast -> Use user’s voice to sign in with a secret phrase in seconds 
  * Secure -> Access will automatically be revoked as soon as users move away
